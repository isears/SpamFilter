SpamFilter
===========

Artificial Intelligence -- Naive Bayes Classification Project. A simple spam filter that learns to tell the difference between spam and ham emails by learning from a set of labeled data.

This was one of the last projects for my AI class, so documentation is a little spotty, but feel free to take a look. Feel free to send questions/comments/concerns to:
